He\u2019s better for me. His voice is more true to me.\u2019 Well, to me that just says you don\u2019t like your voice.

            "description": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama \u2014 One of the lessons from Tuesday night\u2019s win for Roy Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate special election primary runoff was that you cannot buy off Alabama voters. Although the final tally on spending on this election by the candidates\u2019 campaigns and outside groups is not yet in, estimates of expenditures on Strange\u2019s behalf have the number at between $15 million and $30 million from the beginning of the campaign through yesterday. Former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore defeated Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) by a vote total of 262,204 to 218,066. If the $30 million number, given to Breitbart News by Drew Messer, a senior adviser to the Moore campaign, and used by Moore in a speech at his campaign event on Monday night, proves to be the case, $137.57 was spent per vote on Strange\u2019s behalf in his losing effort. Moore: If they can't beat me with $30 million then there's a crack in the dam #alpolitics pic.twitter.com/13EXHSZcZd \u2014 Jeff Poor (@jeff_poor) September 26, 2017 That is not quite the cost per vote spent on Jon Ossoff in Georgia\u2019s sixth congressional district special election in June, coming in at $176 per vote.

Limbaugh said, \u201cI got the Breitbart story right here, and that is who they say Trump is mad at is his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. And that\u2019s because Kushner apparently keeps giving Trump advice. As far as Breitbart and the Bannon falling out with Trump, I don\u2019t think Breitbart is off the reservation here. Some people think now that Breitbart is allying with Bannon, it is anti-Trump now. I don\u2019t think that is the case at all. We need to chill out here and realize this all makes sense if you look at it as objectively as you can.\u201d Limbaugh read a quote from the article, \u201cIn what is becoming a disturbing pattern, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, was apparently one of those who advised the president to back Strange, to once again sail into big, jagged rocks\u2014a humiliation for Trump that anyone with any real-world political sense should have seen coming from a mile away.

Now it is time to play the game.\u201d That\u2019s the case as Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore and Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) both made their closing arguments on Monday night shortly before one of the most nationally consequential elections in Alabama\u2019s history. Moore appeared before an estimated 600 people at a rally at Oak Hollow Farms in Baldwin County with some high-profile warm-up acts including former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, former White House strategist Steve Bannon and Duck Commander\u2019s Phil Robertson. Meanwhile, simultaneously 270 miles up the road in Birmingham, Strange appeared before an estimated 350 people at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport with Vice President Mike Pence. Late polling suggests Moore is the favorite in Tuesday\u2019s Republican special election GOP primary runoff. President Donald Trump\u2019s appearance Friday night in Huntsville, AL on Strange\u2019s behalf did little to close the gap for Strange, who has been running between five and ten points behind Moore.

And it\u2019s something that I\u2019m very proud of, whether I agree or disagree.

And I think it\u2019s all part of his political calculation. And I really think that\u2019s bad for the country. He wants to set people against each other.

It\u2019s from Proverbs 3:31 and it reads, \u201cenvy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways.\u201d Today, the oppressors are the bullies of the NFL who kneel or hide when our national anthem is played, forcing a captive audience to witness their vile, insulting, and uninformed view of what America stands for. I\u2019ll tell you what America stands for. We are a nation in which no citizen is treated differently under the law, regardless of their color, race, financial status, creed, or nation of origin. Even these hysterical millionaires have rights. So I encourage all of you to do the same: exercise your rights.

And I had no doubt how people in the NFL from players to the commissioner to media people were gonna get it wrong, and they have, and they did. But if you\u2019ll permit me first, I was personally saddened. I did not watch the National Football League yesterday, and it was the first time in 45 years that I made an active decision not to watch, including my team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was not a decision made in anger. It was genuine sadness. I realized that I can no longer look at this game and watch this game and study this game and pretend, you know, fantasize, everything a fan does. This whole thing has removed",

Anthony Weiner explores a return to politics, the mainstream media have been eager to help him rehabilitate his reputation\u2013and to distort or ignore the role played by Andrew Breitbart in driving the story. Andrew\u2019s victory in Weinergate was as much a triumph over the mainstream media as it was against a Democrat who had falsely claimed to be the victim of a crime\u2013and who had suggested that Andrew could be the culprit. In spinning for Weiner, the mainstream media are attempting to restore their own tarnished reputations. As blogger Ace of Spades noted yesterday: \u201cIt was absolute smoking gun proof offered by Andrew Breitbart that did Weiner in on June 6th [2011], and not \u201cquestions from reporters,\u201d that compelled Weiner to confess. Orwell wrote in 1984: \u201cWho controls the past controls the future.\u201d Whatever Weiner\u2019s future, we will not allow the mainstream media to re-write history to suit their agenda. The following excerpt from the updated paperback edition of Andrew\u2019s book, Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World (Grand Central Publishing, 2012\u2013available at Amazon and Barnes & Noble), tells the Weinergate story precisely as it happened\u2013not as the mainstream media wish it",

Todd said, \u201cMitch McConnell is becoming as much of a political problem for Republican Senate candidates, potential, as Nancy Pelosi is. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened over the last three months. Mitch McConnell never had very positive ratings, but for the most part, he\u2019s been sort of under the radar. More than half the country hasn\u2019t really known who he was. The president has, in his criticism over the last two months of Mitch McConnell, raised Mitch McConnell\u2019s name I.D. and not in a good way.\u201d He continued, \u201cNow his negatives nearly match, for instance, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s negatives. The difference is Nancy Pelosi\u2019s negatives are all coming from the Republican side; Democratic are fairly pleased. In Mitch McConnell\u2019s case, his rise in negative rating is coming from Trump supporters, Not necessarily Republican party supporters, but Trump supporters, let alone Democrats. But that is something where suddenly Mitch McConnell may become a liability in campaigns in",

The 39-year-old Somalian had carried out the attack on his wife in June of last year in the remote municipality of Torpsbruk. He hit his wife with the axe repeatedly and only stopped after waking up their children and then fled, Kronen Zeitung reports.

Police lost track of the Somalian man who then turned up in Austria a month later with no form of identification and claimed that he was actually 29-years-old and requested asylum. He told Austrian authorities that he had fled from Somalia and had lost his identification documents while he was on his way to Europe. One of the reasons he was not caught earlier was that his fingerprints were not in the Swedish database as he had not claimed asylum there. Interpol and Europol put out international warrants for his arrest and posted his picture on the website Europe\u2019s Most Wanted but had few leads on his location. By January of 2017, the",

I don\u2019t think block granting Obamacare makes it go away. It just means you are keeping all the money you\u2019re spending still in Obamacare and reshuffles it. It is taking it from Democrat states and giving it to Republican states. It sets up a perpetual food fight over the formula. What happens if Democrats win?\u201d \u201cThey are going to try and take back that money and give it to Democrat states,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a bad idea, not repealed. However all of that being said, if they narrow the focus to the things we all agree on, expanding health savings accounts, giving governors more freedom though wavers, slowing down the rate of growth of an outrageous entitlement spending, sure, I would be for that.

There\u2019s a great deal of private property ownership along the border. When there was money set aside and a Secure Fencing Act a decade and a half ago, a number of the property owners whose property would be used for that sued. Those cases, many of them are still in litigation. So you\u2019ll have those issues. You have Indian reservations that straddle the border in Arizona, the community lives on both sides of the border. They\u2019ve already said they\u2019re not going to have a wall. So, just the pure doing of it, not to mention the actual cost. Which, you know, I think the numbers I\u2019ve seen are low numbers.

            "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Whenever President Donald Trump is about to embark on a major diplomatic initiative, like clockwork CNN, the Washington Post or the New York Times drop a leak about the Trump-Russia conspiracy narrative seemingly designed to taint the presidency with the aura of treason. With Trump\u2019s major foreign policy speech today at the United Nations General Assembly, it was only a matter of which of those three news media outlets would drop an anonymously sourced story attempting to once again tie Trump to Russia despite the lack of any actual evidence. As we learned last night, it was CNN\u2019s turn. Lo and behold, the cable network that played a critical role in originally publicizing the existence of a largely discredited 35-page dossier on Trump released a new story last night trying to ratchet up the Russia conspiracy storyline. CNN cited \u201cthree sources familiar with\u201d the Russia investigation revealing that the government utilized a FISA court warrant to secretly snoop on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort before and after the 2016 presidential election, including during periods when Manafort was known to have communicated with Trump. One has to read to the bottom of the story to discover that",
